# Windows93 Community - 2nd Gen

Windows 93 is an awesome Web OS available at https://windows93.net. The site used to have a large amount of community members, interested in win93. However, since the series of [Incidents in 2021](https://bit.ly/windows93history), the amount of community members has died off. Because of this, I have decided to create a github organization dedicated to the windows 93 community. The original one, available at https://github.com/windows93-community is completely inactive and has no new projects since last year.
